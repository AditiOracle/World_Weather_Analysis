**OVERVIEW:**

Through this challenge we tried to retrieve the random, 2000, Longitudes and Latitudes for the nearest city. Using the OpenWeatherMap we tried to get the cities weather conditions and saved that information in csv file using a dataframe.

Using this information, we asked the users to input the minimum and maximum temperature for the cities they want to visit. Based on that criteria we identified potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then using the Google nearbysearch API tried to find out the hotel names from those cities. We saved that hotels and their cities information in a dataframe and exported in a csv file. After that, using gmaps created the marker layer map for all the cities.

After that, we selected 4 cities for our vacation, retrieved their information, saved in dataframes and combined all 4 dataframes to create the itineray map using direction layer gmap. At last, we created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
